As an assignment, you have to write the HTML of a website without thinking about
styling. Then, you have to create the layout with only CSS (no HTML changes or
JavaScript allowed).

What do you do?

You find out everything you can about *Power CSS&#8482;* to blow everyone's
minds, of course!

Here's Ten Amazing Things You Didn't Know You Could Do With CSS:

# Make a dropdown menu
This one's pretty simple and has been done for years:

```scss
ul.dropdown::before {
  content: 'Menu';
}

ul.dropdown > li {
  display: none;
}

ul.dropdown:hover > li,
ul.dropdown:focus > li {
  display: block;
}
```

A "Menu" link will appear before your list, and the list will become visible
when you hover over that link. The `:focus` part is necessary for when you're on
a touch screen---otherwise the menu will disappear as soon as you lift your
finger.


# Make a hamburger icon

That "Menu" stuff is *so* 2010. Now hamburger icons are all the rage! We'll make
one with plain CSS, creating a block for the middle line and two `box-shadow`s
for the top and bottom lines:

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="ZWamrN" data-default-tab="css" data-user="mrcl" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/mrcl/pen/ZWamrN/">Hamburger icon dropdown</a> by Marcel (<a href="http://codepen.io/mrcl">@mrcl</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>



# Toggle it!

What if I told you...you can make a toggle in pure CSS? The problem with
interactive things in CSS is that there's no way to save state. But what you
*can* do, is create a hidden `checkbox` field and use CSS selectors to do things
based on the state of that element.

Let's upgrade our menu so you can click it to expand:

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="dMZQeN" data-default-tab="css" data-user="mrcl" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/mrcl/pen/dMZQeN/">Toggleable menu</a> by Marcel (<a href="http://codepen.io/mrcl">@mrcl</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

The `label` wrapper gives us two advantages:

1. You don't have to specify an `id` attribute for every dropdown checkbox you
   make. Because the `input` is *inside* the `label`, it doesn't need a `for`
   attribute.
2. Since the entire menu is also the toggle button, you can hide the actual
   checkbox easily and you have **TOTAL MODDING FREEDOM**.
   

# Numbered headings and figures

If you've ever written a scientific paper or report in HTML (that's what the WWW
was made for initially!), you might have written some nasty JavaScript to count
headings, figures and whatnot (or, god forbid, even hard-coded those numbers in
your HTML).

But don't worry my dear, your days of torment are over! For we can use the magic
of CSS to add numbering to your headings, figures and everything you could dream
of. Let's do it.

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="GZOwwy" data-default-tab="css" data-user="mrcl" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/mrcl/pen/GZOwwy/">Numbered headings and figures</a> by Marcel (<a href="http://codepen.io/mrcl">@mrcl</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

# Animations on page load
Show off your design skills by animating your logo every time someone visits
your website! 

It's pretty easy, actually. You just need to define some keyframes and attach
them to the element(s) you want to animate.

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="jqaQgo" data-default-tab="css" data-user="mrcl" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/mrcl/pen/jqaQgo/">jqaQgo</a> by Marcel (<a href="http://codepen.io/mrcl">@mrcl</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


# Add icons to special links

You've probably used attribute selectors like `input[type=checkbox]`. Now,
there's more where that came from! You can match based on part of the value, the
beginning or end and more! Check out the
[MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors)
for all of them.

You could use this to add a cool enevlope icon to all `mailto:`-links, or
Wikipedia-style icons for external links:

I frequent [unicode-table.com](http://unicode-table.com/en/) to find these icons.

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="ONOryB" data-default-tab="css" data-user="mrcl" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/mrcl/pen/ONOryB/">ONOryB</a> by Marcel (<a href="http://codepen.io/mrcl">@mrcl</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
